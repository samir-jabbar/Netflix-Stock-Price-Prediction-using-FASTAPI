# Netflix-Stock-Price-Prediction-using-FASTAPI

This project is an implementation of a Netflix stock price prediction model using FastAPI, a modern web framework for building APIs with Python. The project includes several files that are essential for the stock price prediction and serving it through an API. Below, you will find an overview of the files in this repository.

## Files

1. **NFLX.csv**
   - This CSV file contains historical Netflix stock price data. It is used to train and test the prediction model.

2. **README.md**
   - You are currently reading this file, which provides an overview of the project and its components.

3. **app.py**
   - The main FastAPI application file. It defines the API endpoints and integrates the stock price prediction model to serve predictions.

4. **model.pkl**
   - This is a serialized machine learning model saved in a pickle file. It is used by the FastAPI application to make stock price predictions.

5. **netflix-stock-price-prediction.ipynb**
   - Jupyter Notebook that contains the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. It gives insights into how the prediction model was built.

6. **Netflix-Stock-Price-Prediction-using-FASTAPI**
   - This directory may contain additional code and assets related to the FastAPI application and the project.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

2. Install the required dependencies:

3. Open the `netflix-stock-price-prediction.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook to understand the data preprocessing and model training process.

4. Run the FastAPI application using the following command:

5. You can access the API and make stock price predictions by sending HTTP requests to the defined endpoints.

## API Endpoints

This project defines several API endpoints, including but not limited to:

- `/predict`: Predict the Netflix stock price for a given date.

For detailed documentation on how to use these endpoints, please refer to the FastAPI application and the API documentation.
